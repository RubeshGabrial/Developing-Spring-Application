### 🛠️ Practice: Tasks

- **REST API**: Crafted to streamline product management.
- **Domain Layer**: Houses the `Product` class, encapsulating crucial product details.
- **Repository Layer**: Leverages Spring Data JPA for seamless MySQL integration.
- **Service Layer**: Provides business logic to handle product data efficiently.
- **Controller Layer**: API endpoints defined with GET, POST, and DELETE operations.
- **Dependency Injection**: Meticulously autowired for optimal component interaction.
- **Testing**: Vetted through Postman to ensure impeccable performance.

### 📦 Product Class Structure

- `productId`: The unique identifier for each product.
- `productName`: The name of the product.
- `productDescription`: A detailed overview of the product.
- `amountInStock`: The current stock quantity of the product.

---

### 💾 Database Configuration

Ensure that MySQL is properly installed and configured on your machine. Refer to `.env.example` for environment setup.

---

### 📝 Testing Endpoints

Utilize Postman to send requests and verify the API responses. Import the provided Postman collection for a suite of test requests.

---

### 🌐 API Endpoints

- `GET /api/products`: Retrieve all products.
- `POST /api/products`: Add a new product.
- `GET /api/products/{id}`: Get a product by ID.
- `DELETE /api/products/{id}`: Remove a product from the inventory.
